There are severale steps in this project.
Here we are working with ShipWreck Collection from MongoDB Database
Step 1: We fetch data based upon depth from our collection and apply pagination on that.
Extra C: We apply validation for the data we get from user using Celebrate library.
Step 3: We use HandleBars to do the same step but with UI/UX.

We also insert, update and delete data basedupon id.
Here id is converted to ObjectID.
